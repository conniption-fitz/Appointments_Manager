## User Guide
On program startup, the application will display a Login screen. The user must input a valid Username and Password to
proceed. Once logged in, the user will see a Dashboard with three menu option: Customer, Appointments, and Reports. The
Customer page allows the user to add, edit, and delete customers from the database. The Appointments page displays all
appointments in the current month, or the upcoming week, and allows the user to add, edit, or delete appointments. The
Reports page allows the user to view appointments by Contact, view the number of appointments by month and type, and
view the number of customers by division.

## Additional Report
The third report available on the Reports page generates the number of customers in a selected division. This
information can be used to develop plans for customer growth in certain regions, or analyze customer demographics.
